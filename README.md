# Deep-Structured-Energy-Based-Models-for-Anomaly-Detection
Project Description
This project implements Deep Structured Energy-Based Models (DSEBM) for unsupervised anomaly detection. The model is trained on the KDDCup99 10% dataset, a benchmark dataset used for network intrusion detection. By leveraging energy-based learning, the model effectively distinguishes between normal and anomalous network activities.
