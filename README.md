# Deep-Structured-Energy-Based-Models-for-Anomaly-Detection 

Project description
This project aims to develop a Deep Structured Energy-Based Model (DSEBM) for unsupervised anomaly detection, particularly in network traffic analysis. The model is trained on the KDDCup99_10 dataset, a benchmark dataset for intrusion detection, and leverages energy-based learning to differentiate between normal and anomalous patterns.
